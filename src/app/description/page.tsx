                        One day, while working on a project that involved reading through numerous lengthy PDF documents, I found myself overwhelmed. The documents were dense with information, and I struggled to keep track of all the details. I wished there was a way to quickly find the information I needed without having to read through every single page.
                        As I sat at his desk, sipping my coffee and staring at the stack of PDFs, an idea began to take shape in my mind. What if I could create a chatbot that could read and understand PDF documents just like a human? A chatbot that could answer questions about the content and even provide clues about where to find specific information.
                        Inspired, I started researching natural language processing and machine learning. I faced many challenges along the way, but his passion and determination kept me going.
